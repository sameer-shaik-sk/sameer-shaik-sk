## EXPERIENCE 
### Intel Corporation - IP Logic Design Engineer                             
### RTL IP Development and Integration                                                         Apr 2023 - Jul 2025 
- Implemented spec/PCR-driven updates to synthesizable RTL across PCD and PCH programs, including FSM control logic 
and protocol enhancements. 
- Developed RTL IP blocks across multiple RTL milestones and added SVA assertions within the RTL to validate FSM and 
reset behavior. 
- Performed RTL ECO implementation and validated results using Cadence Formality and Synopsys FEV for logical 
equivalence. 
- Executed lint cleanup using Synopsys VC Lint and resolved structural, coding-style, and synthesis-related issues. 
- Performed CDC/RDC analysis and connectivity checks to ensure clean integration and timing-safe RTL handoff. 
- Collaborated with architects and design leads during feature definition, micro-architecture reviews, and integration signoff. 
- Supported multi-IP SoC integration, debugging inter-block issues related to interface mismatches, resets, and clocking.

## Design Verification (UVM & Formal Verification) 
- Developed and enhanced UVM components (driver, sequencer, monitor, scoreboard, coverage) for IP-level verification of 
multiple features. 
- Implemented constrained-random stimulus and functional coverage models and contributed to overall coverage closure. 
- Identified RTL issues through verification results and drove resolution in collaboration with design and architecture teams. 
- Collaborated with DV teams on testplans, coverage reviews, and RTL debug across simulation and synthesis environments. 
- Developed targeted UVM sequences and testcases to reproduce complex scenarios and validate IP functionality. 
- Developed SVA properties and contributed to formal analysis for selected IP features using JasperGold. 
- Mentored new hires by sharing SVA debugging techniques, formal workflows, and analysis methodologies. 
- Shared formal verification results with design and architecture teams to support debugging and improve specifications.
