## EXPERIENCE 
## Intel Corporation - IP Logic Design Engineer                             
## RTL IP Development and Integration                                                         Apr 2023 - Jul 2025 
• Implemented spec/PCR-driven updates to synthesizable RTL across PCD and PCH programs, including FSM control logic 
and protocol enhancements. 
• Developed RTL IP blocks across multiple RTL milestones and added SVA assertions within the RTL to validate FSM and 
reset behavior. 
• Performed RTL ECO implementation and validated results using Cadence Formality and Synopsys FEV for logical 
equivalence. 
• Executed lint cleanup using Synopsys VC Lint and resolved structural, coding-style, and synthesis-related issues. 
• Performed CDC/RDC analysis and connectivity checks to ensure clean integration and timing-safe RTL handoff. 
• Collaborated with architects and design leads during feature definition, micro-architecture reviews, and integration signoff. 
• Supported multi-IP SoC integration, debugging inter-block issues related to interface mismatches, resets, and clocking.

## Design Verification (UVM & Formal Verification) 
• Developed and enhanced UVM components (driver, sequencer, monitor, scoreboard, coverage) for IP-level verification of 
multiple features. 
• Implemented constrained-random stimulus and functional coverage models and contributed to overall coverage closure. 
• Identified RTL issues through verification results and drove resolution in collaboration with design and architecture teams. 
• Collaborated with DV teams on testplans, coverage reviews, and RTL debug across simulation and synthesis environments. 
• Developed targeted UVM sequences and testcases to reproduce complex scenarios and validate IP functionality. 
• Developed SVA properties and contributed to formal analysis for selected IP features using JasperGold. 
• Mentored new hires by sharing SVA debugging techniques, formal workflows, and analysis methodologies. 
• Shared formal verification results with design and architecture teams to support debugging and improve specifications.

## Intel Corporation - Graduate Technical Intern(RTL & Verification)               Jan 2022 - Dec 2022 
• Implemented SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) in RTL to validate design specifications. 
• Developed Python and Perl scripts to automate regression workflows and result analysis, reducing time by ~20%.
